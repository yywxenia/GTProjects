# Extra Requirements

**Authors**: Team 52
**Updates**:  Revision 0

## Introduction
During our first several meetings our team discussed the mention of the "user" in the design specificaiton.  Our team decided that it would be good to implement a "User" class and allow for multiple users of the application.  A user would be made up of a username, password, and email address.

## Conclusion
Once project implementation began, our team realized the overhead of implementing multiple users, and the complexity that extra requirement meant to our back-end database.  After much conversation, our team decided to drop the requirement for multiple users and implemented the program without multiple users.

It is important to note that some work was done in the appliation to support this effort and there were several classes written to suppor this functionality.  These classes have not been removed at the time of this writing.  If this were a "real" applicaiton it is possible that a future version of the applcation could include the multi-user code.
