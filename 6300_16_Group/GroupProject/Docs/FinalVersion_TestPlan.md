# Test Plan For Grocery List Manager Mobile Application (GLM)

**Author**: Yiwei Yan, Team 52

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

#### Introduction

An mobile android application named "Grocery List Manager (GLM)" has been built. This app is used for creating and editing users' grocery lists. The functionality of this application allows users to:
* Create, delete, rename and select lists; 
* Add, delete items and change quantity of items in a list;
* Search items by name in the database that group on item types;
* Add new items to the database;
* "Check-off” items for edition and clear off the check-off marks in lists;
* Save all modifications.

#### Testing Process and Strategies
The testing process for the Grocery List Manager (GLM) Android Application is broken down to different phases:

* (1) Unit Testing
Unit testing evaluates the individual module/unit of the application. Unit testing is done at the developer's site to check whether a particular piece/unit of code is working fine. We test the components mentioned in section “2.1 Component Diagram”. Unit testing is done by developer team52 to check the each piece of unit code using Junit, which is a testing framework that was developed for the Java programming providing an easy way for unit tests.

* (2) Integration Testing
Integration test evaluate the interaction among different modules/units in unit testing. It is performed when various modules are integrated with each other to form sub-systems. In this phase focuses are mostly in the design and construction of the software architecture. The developer team52 performs this phase also using JUnit.

* (3) System Testing
System test tests the complete system of the application. There includes a set of test cases focused on evaluation of the user interface functionality. It is done by tester team52.

* (4) Regression Testing
Regression testing of this application consists of retesting the successful execution of the system testing. Any errors detected in the formal testing process is recorded in the bug tracking and fixing table as shown in Tables.
Retesting for fixed bugs has done by respective tester team52 once it is resolved by respective developer team52 and bug/defect status is updated accordingly.

### 1.2 Test Selection

#### Black box testing
Internal system design is not considered in this type of testing. Tests are based on requirements and functionality: Therefore, Team52 uses this methodology for system testing which is tested as per the requirements and based on overall requirements specifications, covers all combined parts of a system, regression testing.

#### White box testing
This testing is based on knowledge of the internal logic of an application’s code. Tests are based on coverage of code statements, branches, paths, conditions: Therefore, Team52 uses this method for unit testing, integration testing.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

* Branch Coverage: On Integration Testing, System Testing 
* Condition Coverage: On Unit Testing
* Modified Condition/Decision Coverage: On the important combinations of conditions instead of all of other details (Table 1):

### 1.4 Bug Tracking and Technology

* We install Barista and launch GLM app from it.
* We used JUnit in testing.
* We utilize Barista to help on generating tests efficiently.
* We record the tracking and fixing of bugs as shown in section 2.
* Last testing .java file generated by Barista for the final version of GLM mobile application can be found in Docs folder named "Final_GLMTesting.java".
