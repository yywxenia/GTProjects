We build a Android app named "TipCalculator" to do simple calculation of payment per person:

Usage:

1. Launch the app;

2. In the "Check amount", put in the amount of the check to split;

3. In the "Party size", put in the number of people who split the check;

4. Press "Compute Tip", then in the "Tips and totals" section, the amounts of tips and total per person under different tip percentage will be displayed.

*In the case that input is not valid, e.g. empty/negative check amount or empty/non-positive party size, an alert "Empty or incorrect value(s)!" will show up at the bottom.
